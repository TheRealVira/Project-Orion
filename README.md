# LDAP_SEARCH_BASE=ou=users,dc=company,dc=com
```

**‚ú® Key Features:**
- Works out of the box without any configuration
- Features auto-disable if dependencies are missing
- Startup warnings for production configuration issues
- Supports multiple authentication methods simultaneously

### First Time Setup

On first run, the application will:
1. Create the SQLite database at `data/orion.db`
2. Initialize the database schema
3. Seed sample data (users, teams, assignments)
4. Create a default admin user

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@orion.local` (configurable via `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`)
- Password: `admin123` (configurable via `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Change these immediately in production!**

You can customize the default admin user by setting these environment variables in your `.env` file:
```env
DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@orion.local
DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME=Administrator
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
```

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Login**: Use the default admin credentials or create a new account
2. **Create Users**: Navigate to the "Users" tab and add team members
3. **Create Teams**: Go to "Teams" tab and organize users into teams
4. **Schedule Assignments**: Use the "Calendar" tab to assign on-call duties
5. **Track Incidents**: Switch to "Incidents" tab to manage ongoing issues
6. **Setup Shadows**: Use "Shadows" tab to pair experienced members with new ones
7. **View Analytics**: Check "Analytics" tab for workload distribution insights

## Webhook Integration

Project Orion supports webhook integrations from popular monitoring tools. Admins can use the built-in webhook tester to send test alerts.

### Configuration

**Enable Webhooks:**
```bash
ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=true  # Enabled by default
```

**Secure Webhooks (Optional):**
```bash
# Set a webhook secret for signature verification
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-random-secret-key

# Webhooks must include these headers:
# x-webhook-signature: HMAC-SHA256(timestamp + body)
# x-webhook-timestamp: Unix timestamp in milliseconds
```

### Supported Formats

- **Prometheus AlertManager**: Standard Prometheus alert format
- **Grafana**: Grafana alert notifications
- **Dynatrace**: Dynatrace problem notifications
- **Generic**: Custom JSON payloads

### Webhook Endpoint

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/alerts
Content-Type: application/json
x-webhook-signature: <signature>  # Optional, required if WEBHOOK_SECRET set
x-webhook-timestamp: <timestamp>  # Optional, required if WEBHOOK_SECRET set
```

### Example Payload (Prometheus)

```json
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "fingerprint": "alert_12345",
      "labels": {
        "alertname": "HighCPUUsage",
        "severity": "critical",
        "instance": "server-01",
        "team": "Product A"
      },
      "annotations": {
        "summary": "CPU usage above 90%",
        "description": "Server server-01 CPU usage is at 95%"
      },
      "status": "firing"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Smart Team & Member Assignment

Webhooks use intelligent cascading logic to assign incidents:

**Team Assignment:**
1. **Tag Matching**: Matches alert tags/labels to team names (case-insensitive)
   - Example: `team: "product a"` ‚Üí Matches "Product A" team
   - Checks: `team`, `service`, `product`, `component`, `app`, `application` fields
2. **On-Call Schedule**: Uses today's on-call team if no tag match
3. **First Available**: Assigns to first available team if no one is on-call

**Member Assignment (within matched team):**
1. **Today's On-Call**: Assigns to member on-call today for that team
2. **Team Owner**: Assigns to team owner if no one is on-call
3. **Any Team Member**: Assigns to first team member if no owner
4. **Team Only**: Assigns to team without specific member if team is empty

This ensures alerts are never lost and always reach the right people! üéØ
