## Package Manager Migration to pnpm

### üéâ What Changed

Project Orion has migrated from npm to **pnpm** for improved performance and disk space efficiency. This migration includes:

‚úÖ **Benefits:**
- ‚ö° **3x faster** installations
- üíæ **50% less disk space** used for dependencies
- üîí **Stricter dependency resolution** for better security
- üì¶ **Monorepo-ready** with pnpm workspaces
- üå≥ **Flat node_modules** structure (when using symlinks or hoisting)

### Updated Configuration Files

The following files were updated for pnpm compatibility:

- **`.npmrc`**: Registry settings and timeout configurations for reliable installations
- **`package.json`**: Engine requirement now specifies `pnpm >=9.0.0`
- **`Dockerfile`**: Multi-stage build now uses pnpm with global installation
- **`GitHub Actions`**: CI/CD workflows updated to use pnpm/action-setup
- **`.gitignore`**: Added pnpm-specific cache patterns and build artifacts
- **`pnpm-lock.yaml`**: Lock file generated with all 590+ dependencies frozen

### Migration Guide

If you were previously using npm or yarn:

```bash
# 1. Remove old lock files
rm package-lock.json yarn.lock

# 2. Clear old caches
npm cache clean --force
pnpm store prune

# 3. Install with pnpm
pnpm install

# 4. Verify installation
pnpm --version  # Should be 9.0.0+
pnpm list       # Verify all dependencies
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: `ERR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT` during installation**
- Solution: Check `.npmrc` configuration or increase timeout values
- File: `.npmrc` with fetch-timeout=60000 and fetch-retries=5

**Issue: Build tools missing for native modules**
- Solution: Ensure build tools are installed (Python, gcc, make, etc.)
- Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools or node-gyp
- macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools
- Linux: build-essential package

**Issue: Module resolution errors**
- Solution: Run `pnpm install --force` to rebuild dependencies
- Or: Delete `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`, then run `pnpm install`

### Available Package Manager Commands

All standard npm commands work with pnpm:

```bash
# Installation
pnpm install              # Install all dependencies
pnpm add <package>        # Add a new package
pnpm add -D <package>     # Add as dev dependency
pnpm add -g <package>     # Install globally

# Updates
pnpm update               # Update all packages
pnpm update <package>     # Update specific package

# Maintenance
pnpm prune                # Remove unused dependencies
pnpm audit                # Security audit
pnpm audit --fix          # Auto-fix vulnerabilities
```

## Webhook Integration

Project Orion supports webhook integrations from popular monitoring tools. Admins can use the built-in webhook tester to send test alerts.

### Configuration

**Enable Webhooks:**
```bash
ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=true  # Enabled by default
```

**Secure Webhooks (Optional):**
```bash
# Set a webhook secret for signature verification
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-random-secret-key

# Webhooks must include these headers:
# x-webhook-signature: HMAC-SHA256(timestamp + body)
# x-webhook-timestamp: Unix timestamp in milliseconds
```

### Supported Formats

- **Prometheus AlertManager**: Standard Prometheus alert format
- **Grafana**: Grafana alert notifications
- **Dynatrace**: Dynatrace problem notifications
- **Generic**: Custom JSON payloads

### Webhook Endpoint

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/alerts
Content-Type: application/json
x-webhook-signature: <signature>  # Optional, required if WEBHOOK_SECRET set
x-webhook-timestamp: <timestamp>  # Optional, required if WEBHOOK_SECRET set
```

### Example Payload (Prometheus)

```json
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "fingerprint": "alert_12345",
      "labels": {
        "alertname": "HighCPUUsage",
        "severity": "critical",
        "instance": "server-01",
        "team": "Product A"
      },
      "annotations": {
        "summary": "CPU usage above 90%",
        "description": "Server server-01 CPU usage is at 95%"
      },
      "status": "firing"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Smart Team & Member Assignment

Webhooks use intelligent cascading logic to assign incidents:

**Team Assignment:**
1. **Tag Matching**: Matches alert tags/labels to team names (case-insensitive)
   - Example: `team: "product a"` ‚Üí Matches "Product A" team
   - Checks: `team`, `service`, `product`, `component`, `app`, `application` fields
2. **On-Call Schedule**: Uses today's on-call team if no tag match
3. **First Available**: Assigns to first available team if no one is on-call

**Member Assignment (within matched team):**
1. **Today's On-Call**: Assigns to member on-call today for that team
2. **Team Owner**: Assigns to team owner if no one is on-call
3. **Any Team Member**: Assigns to first team member if no owner
4. **Team Only**: Assigns to team without specific member if team is empty

This ensures alerts are never lost and always reach the right people! üéØ

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Build verification
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Run type checks

‚úÖ Security Audit Job (Separate)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run pnpm audit with moderate risk level
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate security report
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Continue on error (non-blocking)

‚úÖ Docker Build Job
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Build Docker image with pnpm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Test multi-stage build
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Verify image integrity
```

**Key Features:**
- Frozen lockfile enforcement (`--frozen-lockfile`) prevents version drifts
- Separate security audit job doesn't block build pipeline
- pnpm caching reduces installation time by ~80%
- Multi-job parallelization for faster feedback

#### Release Pipeline (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`)

Triggered by version tags (`v*.*.*`):

```yaml
‚úÖ Test Job (Pre-release validation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run all tests with pnpm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Verify build succeeds
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ensure no regressions

‚úÖ Build Docker Job (Multi-platform)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Build for linux/amd64 (Intel/AMD)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Build for linux/arm64 (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Push to ghcr.io
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate SBOMs

‚úÖ Build Artifacts Job
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Create standalone package (.tar.gz)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Create deployment package with Docker files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Upload to release page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate release notes
```

**Release Platforms:**
- `linux/amd64` - x86_64 (Intel/AMD servers)
- `linux/arm64` - ARM64 (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4+, AWS Graviton)

#### Workflow Benefits

- üîí **Security**: pnpm audit ensures dependencies are safe
- ‚ö° **Speed**: pnpm caching + frozen lockfile = faster builds
- üîÑ **Consistency**: Lockfile ensures reproducible builds
- üì¶ **Reliability**: Multi-stage builds with dependency verification
- üìä **Transparency**: Detailed logs and build artifacts

### Docker Images

Pre-built Docker images are available on GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Pull latest stable release
docker pull ghcr.io/therealvira/project-orion:latest

# Pull specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/therealvira/project-orion:v0.1.0

# Pull latest commit from main branch
docker pull ghcr.io/therealvira/project-orion:main
```

**Supported platforms:**
- `linux/amd64` - x86_64 (Intel/AMD)
- `linux/arm64` - ARM64 (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4+, ARM servers)

### Creating a Release

```bash
# 1. Update version with pnpm
pnpm version patch  # or minor, or major

# 2. Create and push tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

This automatically triggers the build and release pipeline.

### Release Artifacts

Each release includes:
- üê≥ **Docker images** (multi-platform)
- üì¶ **Standalone package** (.tar.gz with built application)
- üöÄ **Deployment package** (.tar.gz with Docker files and configs)
